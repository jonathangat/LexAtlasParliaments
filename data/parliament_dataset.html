        government.</td>
      <td>The 2021 election saw a change in President from the Independent SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era to Gabriel Boric (Social
        Convergence in the Alliance of Apruebo Dignidad). There was significant churn of legislative seats between
        political coalitions. But no single party holds a majority of seats so the government type remains divided.</td>
      <td>One-party state</td>
      <td>Presidents are allowed to serve for a single-term only. The new president - rodrigo Chaves - comes to power
        with a weak mandate</td>
      <td>Merger of parties in 2019 gave the governing party a super majority. The Prosperity Party (effectively a
        rebranding of the previous governing EPRDF) retained their super majority in the House of Peoples'
        Representatives.</td>
      <td>Over sixed coalition containing 6 parties.</td>
      <td>Emmanuel Macron defeated Marine Le Pen and was re-elected as President of France.</td>
      <td>The 2021 elections saw the CDU-SPD-CSU coalition replaced by a coalition between SPD-Greens-FDP.</td>
      <td>The Legislative Council of Hong Kong is almost entirely pro-Beijing in its composition. The Parliament
        operates within a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. The 2021 election saw no
        change in either the composition or the pro-Beijing control of the Legislative Council.</td>

        party oversized (supermajority) coalition in the People's Representative Council.</td>
      <td>Elections held on 8/2/2020 (before the Covid-19 pandemic), but which took until 27/6/2020 to form a
        government. Leo Veradkar headed a minoirty coalition of the Fine Gael and independents until 27/6/2020. After

      <td>Political crisis with a caretaker government seeking to circumvent parliament [with the help of the speaker]
        in 2020. The 2021 election saw the removal of Likud, the senior coalition partner and party of former PM
        Benjamin Netanyahu, from the coalition government. A new 8 party coalition was formed following the 2021
        election headed by Naftali Bennett (Yamina alliance).</td>

        Italy, a radical-right political party, winning an absolute majority of seats in the Italian Parliament.</td>

        before the election to 49 after) over the People's National Party.</td>

        majority of seats in both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies before and after the 2021 election.</td>
      <td>The election saw no change in the composition of the exiting coalition. The government continued until 10
        January 2022 when a continuation cabinet containing the same parties was formed.</td>
      <td>New Zealand had a minority government prior to the 2020 election comprised of the Labour Party and New Zealand
        First with a confidence and supply agreement with the Greens. The 2020 election saw large gains for the Labour
        Party, winning 65 of the 120 seats, and forming a single party majority government alongside a cooperation
        agreement (falling short of a coalition) with the Greens.</td>
      <td>The right-wing majoirty coalition collapsed in January 2020 when the Progress Party left coalition over
        repatriation of former ISIS member. This meant a minoirty coalition went into the pandemic. In the 2021
        election, seat losses by the Conservatives and gains by the Centre Party allowed for the formation of a
        centre-left minority coalition government conatining the Labour Party and Centre Party to be formed after the
        election.</td>

      <td>The incumbent President, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, was reelected for a second term.</td>
      <td>A political crisis has gone hand in hand with the pandemic. The government was formed on 14/3/2020 but was
        dismissed after a vote of no confidence in December 2020. The 2020 legislative elections saw the Prime
        Minister's Social Democratic Party lose seats and three parties (the Liberal Party, USR Plus and UDMR) form a

      <td>In spring 2020, following an agreement by the speakers of the different parties, the numbers of MPs present in
        the National Council during parliamentary sessions was reduced proportionallyâonly to an extent that all
        constitutional requirements on quora were met</td>
      <td>Plenary meetings have been held in a hybrid format, with only two members of each political group. Select
        committees met either by video conference or in a hybrid format. MPs not physically present able to vote
        electronically from the date of 26 March 2020. Some plenary meeting was held in the European Parliament in
        Brussels, a location where social distancing between MPs could be respected.</td>
      <td>The Congress was never closed, but debating and voting procedures have been virtual for six months. The two
        Housesâthe Senate and Chamber of Deputiesâand their respective committees were able to maintain their agenda
        with virtual meetings, which involves the passage of legislation and parliamentary committee meetings. There
        were no abnormal constraints on the process of voting, on the number of persons permitted to participate in
        plenary debates, or on the process for posing questions and offering rejoinders to answers.</td>
      <td>When adjourned used the 'unanimous consent' procedure to fast track the adoption of Covid-19 legislation. The
        process limits the opportunity for debate. In July and August questioning of ministers on Covid-19 related
        matters was limited to 95 mins and Covid-19 related debates limited to 2 hrs 20 mins</td>
      <td>No reduction</td>
      <td>Standing committeees unable to conduct usual meetings. Move to partial sessions online</td>
      <td>Legislature moved to a nearby museum and plenary sessions held in a socially distanced manner. Political party
        caucus meetings were moved online.</td>
      <td>No reduction</td>
      <td>Only neccessary and urgent issues discussed in Parliament from the 24 March 2020. Committee chairs along with
        government ministers ruled on what was neccessary and urgent. These restrictions were renewed twice for March
        and April 2021. In March 2020, parliamentary groups decided to restrict the number of MPs in plenary sessions. A
        maximum of 54 MPs (out of 200) were allowed to take part in the plenary sessions; the places were distributed
        according to the proportion of the seats of each party. It was also decided that incidental majorities, eg due
        to quarantine of MPs, would not be allowed in parliamentary voting so as not to slow down the normal legislative
        proceedings. From 9 September 2020 onwards, the maximum number of MPs in plenary sessions was raised to 74. The
        necessity of this restriction was to be reviewed at the end of September 2021.</td>
      <td>Access to parliamentary estate restricted from 22/3/2020. Initially 3 members per political group, increased
        to 75 (of 577 total) from 27/4/2020, 151 from 27/5/2020 and all deputies after 22/6/2020. Initially 18 Senators
        allowed access from 24/3/2020. Then slowly increased to 189 (half the chamber) by 22/6/2020. Party Presidents
        authorised to cast votes on behalf of their party representatives. During this period, both chambers decided to
        focus their work on emergency legislation linked to the Covid-19 crisis, especially the statutes related to the
        state of health emergency, and financial statutes.</td>
      <td>At the beginning of the pandemic, parliamentary groups reduced the number of present representatives by a
        pairing agreement in order to keep physical distance. Rules of Proceedings amended to lower the quorum
        requirement (quarter of members rather than half). In committees, members could attend meetings and vote through
        electronic means of communication. However, electronic meetings and voting have not been introduced for plenary
        sessions.</td>

      <td>No reduction</td>
      <td>Reduced attendance from 19/3/2020 with 30% capacity, with members sitting proportionally in relation to the
        proportion of seats held by their party. No ordinary committees sat between January and October 2020.</td>
      <td>A limit was placed on the numbers attending plenary sessions for a brief period. Physical attendance was also
        limited in committees, though virtual proceedings meant operations were not limited.</td>
      <td>Significant disruption and limitations to proceedings. Plenary sessions reduced between March and mid-June
        when both chambers met only a couple of times per week. The calendar was modified to give priority to urgent
        bills and transposing statutiry decrees into statute. Number of members allowed to participate in plenary
        reduced. Following a âgentlemenâs agreementâ, groups decided to limit the attendance to 55% of the total members
        of each House (350 deputies and 161 senators). Nonetheless, despite the said agreement, the attendance was often
        much higher. For example, 412 deputies were present at the plenary that took place on 14 April 2020, and 246
        senators participated at the plenary of 9 April 2020 [para 39]. However, the quorum not being reached in a

        Report from this committee is sent to each chamber who can then intervene. The process sees very few decrees
        being rejected and this remained the case with Covid-19. President used his majority in the upper chamber and
        strong presence in the lower chamber to help approve decrees with only minor exceptions.</td>
      <td>Consent was required from the Main Committee of the National Council for any ordinance. Parliament curtailed
        the power of the Health Ministerby placing time limits of stay at home orders. This required reporting of such
        moves to the parliament. Parliamentary questions were used throughout as a way to scrutinise the exectuive.</td>
      <td>Belgian Parliament has only relatively weak mechanisms for scrutiny of delegated legislation at its disposal,
        since â[s]tatutory instruments are not normally subject to specific parliamentary scrutiny and the Ministerial
        Decrees do not need to be confirmed or reviewed by the House of Representativesâ [para 29]. ). If the
        legislature opposes a regulation, it may repeal the statute providing the powers for its enactment. In respect
        of âspecial powers decreesâ there is some opportunity for retrospective legislative scrutiny, since special
        powers decrees become void if not confirmed by legislatures within the time period specified by the enabling
        act. However, the relatively long time period of one year specified for Covid-19 measures at the Federal level
        made this a relatively weak form of scrutiny.</td>
      <td>No constraints on scrutiny through debates and committee proceedings. A good deal of scrutiny through the
        amendment of primary legislation. Weaker scrutiny of executive decrees in Congress</td>
      <td>Parliament has not played a significant oversight role (mainly due to the lengthy adjournments) but has
        mandated committees to provide ongoing oversight (e.g. Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic set up on

        and to approve extraordinary budgetary measures to fund anti-Covid-19 programs</td>
      <td>Formal powers to oversee the executive. But effectively a one-party state in terms of parliamentary
        representation which curtials scrutiny and oversight</td>
      <td>Parliamentâs oversight takes two forms. First, exceptional powers are put to parliament in the shape of an Act
        after a state of emergency is called. Second, provisional exceptions to the basic rights that are made through
        Government decrees by virtue of Section 23 of the Constitution during a state of emergency are submitted to the
        Parliament. Both pass or fall on a simple majority of Parliament.</td>
      <td>French Parliament generally does not scrutinise secondary legislation [para 32]. So no public health
        regulations were scrutinised by parliament. But health emergency was enacted and powers under that could only be
        extended beyond a month by means of primary statute, so giving Parliament a veto over powers enacted under the
        state of emergency [para 22]. Government was delegated further powers under two statutes which allowed the
        government to issue ordinances. Scrutiny over ordinances is weak and are very likely to become law [see main
        document for reference], but were subject to a 3 month sunset clause.</td>
      <td>Powers given to the Ministry of Health under section 5 of the Infection Protection Act 2000 requires a
        declaration by the Bundestag. If the Bundestag repeals its declaration then all regulations cease with immediate
        effect (and there is a sunset clause dated 31/3/2021) [para 35]. But, it is a take it or leave it power as the
        Bundestag cannot amend or reject individual regulations. An amendment to section 5 in November 2020 to require
        oral reporting by the Federal Government sought to remedy the scrutiny deficit [para 36]</td>

        emergency provisions had to be laid beofre parliament after three months and could be annulled by a reolution of
        either chamber within 21 days. A Special Committee on Covid-19 Response was established 6/5/2020 and reported on
        8/10/2020. Debates were held on Covid-19 measures and committees continued to sit.</td>
      <td>Committees were able to continue their oversight roles despite the caretaker government trying to circumvent

        tradition by no allowing oversight committees to be chaired by members of the opposition. In March 2020, an
        eight-member bipartisan Special Select Committee of the House of Representatives of Parliament was established
        to oversee the Governmentâs response to the pandemic, chaired by the Minister of Health and Wellness. Oversight

        submit an inquiry to the government. If the Saeima supports the inquiry, it may decide, in the context of the
        inquiry, to hold a vote of confidence in the relevant minister or the entire Cabinet. Additionally, Members of
        the Saeima may submit questions to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Governor of the Bank
        of Latvia regarding matters within the scope of competence of these officials. Answers may be submitted in
        writing or provided in person at the relevant sitting of the Saeima.</td>
      <td>Weak powers of scrutiny for Parliament versus the government. The legislature exercised a very limited degree
        of oversight over the normative acts of the executive, including those relating to quarantining entire areas,
        curfews and full closure of businesses and public places, unlike what would be expected in such circumstances.

      <td>Despite powers for Congress to oversee the response to the pandemic, the first hearing was only held on
        30/9/2020. Congress had no say in the declaration of emergency</td>

        Parlaiement greater powers of scrutiny after intititally having very little power over emergency ordinances</td>
      <td>All secondary legislation reviewed by the Regulations Review Committee, and the Committeeâs recommendations
        were reflected in later health orders [para 44]. Delegated legisaltion can be disallowed by parliament if
        referred by the Committee, but this did not occur during the pandemic.</td>
      <td>Tthe regime under the Norwegian Corona Act 2020 provided for more extensive parliamentary scrutiny of
        regulations passed under the Act than for ordinary regulations. Normal ex post scrutiny mechanisms [para 30
        &amp; 32] strengthened to include the ability for parliament to veto a regulation (one-third of Storting members
        required to veto) to off-set the strong powers of the executive to amend or repeal existing statute (Henry VIII
        powers in the UK). Powers could only come into force one day after being introduced to parliament to allow time
        for a veto to be issued.</td>
      <td>Executive dominance of the legisalture makes scrutiny difficult. Ordinances have been used that largely avoid
        or delayt scrutiny from the legislature. A Joint Parliamnetary Committee was established and chaired by the
        Speaker of the National Assembly. But the committee was eventually boycotted by opposition parties who accused
        the speaker of bias towards the ruling party.</td>
      <td>Under the state of emergency scrutiny was limited by the reduction in parliamentary activity. Government acted
        unchecked between 2/5/2020 and 6/11/2020</td>
      <td>State of emergency declared by President but must be approved within 5 days by the parliament and each
        subsequent 30 day extension had to be approved by parliament. Emergency decress had to be laid before parliament
        for ratification (ex post)</td>

        the NDMC to submit reports to parliament for scrutiny.</td>
      <td>Special Committee for the response to Covid-19 established.</td>
      <td>Regular scruitny has taken place throughout the pandemic. Extensions of states of alarm have been approved by
        Congress. Government measures have been scrutinised by way of interpollations and questions and by ministers
        appearing before Committees. A new committee - the Parliamentary Committee for the Social and Economic
        Reconstruction - was established on 7/5/2020. The final report of the committee, setting out strategic actions
        for the economic recovery from the pandemic, was approved by parliament on 29/7/2020</td>
      <td>Central oversight role for Committee on the Constitution. 35.\tThe Committee decided on 24 March 2020 to
        postpone its usual spring control of the government until further notice on account of the Covid-19 outbreak. On

        slow response in its 2021 srping control</td>

        government's pandemic response</td>
      <td>Weak oversight powers of parliament since the 2014 coup. No oversight role over exectuive decree or
        rule-making powers. The coalition government prematurely closed sessions to prevent debate on three emergency
        decrees on the Covid-19 budget</td>
      <td>There is no ongoing parliamentary oversight over ordinary presidential decrees, by-laws, and circulars, all of
        which are the main legal instruments in the Covid-19 response. Questions have been answered slowly, or sometimes
        not at all, byt the Government</td>
      <td>Widespread exercise of delegated powers [permitted through primary legislation in the case of the Coronavirus
        Act 2020] means parliament has not had a chance to scutinise C-19 measures. As of 8/9/2020, 210 Covid-19 UK SIs
        had been made - 162 using negative resolution procedures meaning they are immediately effective unless
        explicitly voted down. Conventions were broken in regard to laying out SIs under negative procedure 21 days
        before coming into force for more than two-thirds of cases. Most of the public health emergency powers enacted
        under existing primary legislation requires subsequent ratification, which it received in parliament, although
        scrutiny was curtailed during this process. Commons scruitny also curtailed by inability to amend SIs [can only
        accept or reject]. Select Committees have played an important oversight role [but this is ex post oversight for
        the large part?]</td>
      <td>Congress has not acted to limit the authority of the President during the pandemic. In several states,

      <td>Opposition parties criticised the suspension in the first month of the pandemic and asked the Supreme Court to
        judge on the legal validity of virtual sessions [possibly more for clarity than in opposition to virtual
        proceeding]. Local level parliaments moved much faster towards hybrid proceedings. Some opposition legislators
        raised concerns about the appropriateness of continued executive rule-making when Congressional law-making was
        in full operation</td>
      <td>Opposition parties strongly opposed a provision within the bill which would have given the Federal Minister of
        Finance the possibility for an overdraft of up to 28 billion Euros of the expenditures projected in the bill
        without giving any details on the purpose of this overdraft except âfinancial countering of the pandemicâ. This
        was criticised as being incompatible with the constitutional requirement of a transparent (federal) budget. The
        opposition used its slim majoirty in the second chamber to block government initiatives. [Karl has also
        mnetioned some subsequent machinations within the governing coalition]</td>

      <td>Disgreement between the federal and state levels over certain regulations</td>
      <td>Complaints by the press and by opposition parties due to the political constraints imposed on Parliament
        during the pandemic. Closed door negotiations for emergency lawmaking have been criticised. A lack of
        representation has been highlighted when Parliament passed Bill C-12, which was emergency legislation, on 13
        March, when only âa small number of senior MPsâ were present, a disproportionate number were from Ontario and
        Quebec. This is problematic as the views expressed during negotiations would not have represented the regional
        diversity across Canada. The Conservative Party critiqued the Liberal governmentâs plan to hold one in-person
        sitting in the House of Commons per week, with only a small number of Members of Parliament present, stating
        that this was not a sufficient number of in-person sittings.</td>
