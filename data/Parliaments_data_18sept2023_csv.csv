The two Houses—the Senate and Chamber of Deputies—and their respective committees were able to maintain their agenda with virtual meetings, which involves the passage of legislation and parliamentary committee meetings. There were no abnormal constraints on the process of voting, on the number of persons permitted to participate in plenary debates, or on the process for posing questions and offering rejoinders to answers.",When adjourned used the 'unanimous consent' procedure to fast track the adoption of Covid-19 legislation.

Committee chairs along with government ministers ruled on what was neccessary and urgent. These restrictions were renewed twice for March and April 2021. In March 2020, parliamentary groups decided to restrict the number of MPs in plenary sessions. A maximum of 54 MPs (out of 200) were allowed to take part in the plenary sessions; the places were distributed according to the proportion of the seats of each party. It was also decided that incidental majorities, eg due to quarantine of MPs, would not be allowed in parliamentary voting so as not to slow down the normal legislative proceedings.  From 9 September 2020 onwards, the maximum number of MPs in plenary sessions was raised to 74. The necessity of this restriction was to be reviewed at the end of September 2021.","Access to parliamentary estate restricted from 22/3/2020. Initially 3 members per political group, increased to 75 (of 577 total) from 27/4/2020, 151 from 27/5/2020 and all deputies after 22/6/2020. Initially 18 Senators allowed access from 24/3/2020. Then slowly increased to 189 (half the chamber) by 22/6/2020. Party Presidents authorised to cast votes on behalf of their party representatives. During this period, both chambers decided to focus their work on emergency legislation linked to the Covid-19 crisis, especially the statutes related to the state of health emergency, and financial statutes.","At the beginning of the pandemic, parliamentary groups reduced the number of present representatives by a pairing agreement in order to keep physical distance. Rules of Proceedings amended to lower the quorum requirement (quarter of members rather than half). In committees, members could attend meetings and vote through electronic means of communication. However, electronic meetings and voting have not been introduced for plenary sessions.","Prior to the closure, plenary and committee sessions were reduced or cancelled",No reduction,"Reduced attendance from 19/3/2020 with 30% capacity, with members sitting proportionally in relation to the proportion of seats held by their party.

Plenary sessions reduced between March and mid-June when both chambers met only a couple of times per week. The calendar was modified to give priority to urgent bills and transposing statutiry decrees into statute. Number of members allowed to participate in plenary reduced. Following a “gentlemen’s agreement”, groups decided to limit the attendance to 55% of the total members of each House (350 deputies and 161 senators). Nonetheless, despite the said agreement, the attendance was often much higher. For example, 412 deputies were present at the plenary that took place on 14 April 2020, and 246 senators participated at the plenary of 9 April 2020 [para 39].

Parliamentary oversight notes,Notes on parliamentary oversight,LAC19 country report,Both houses have the power to intervene in executive decree making through the Standing Bicameral Committee. Report from this committee is sent to each chamber who can then intervene. The process sees very few decrees being rejected and this remained the case with Covid-19. President used his majority in the upper chamber and strong presence in the lower chamber to help approve decrees with only minor exceptions.,Consent was required from the Main Committee of the National Council for any ordinance. Parliament curtailed the power of the Health Ministerby placing time limits of stay at home orders. This required reporting of such moves to the parliament. Parliamentary questions were used throughout as a way to scrutinise the exectuive.,"Belgian Parliament has only relatively weak mechanisms for scrutiny of delegated legislation at its disposal, since ‘[s]tatutory instruments are not normally subject to specific parliamentary scrutiny and the Ministerial Decrees do not need to be confirmed or reviewed by the House of Representatives’ [para 29]. ). If the legislature opposes a regulation, it may repeal the statute providing the powers for its enactment. In respect of ‘special powers decrees’ there is some opportunity for retrospective legislative scrutiny, since special powers decrees become void if not confirmed by legislatures within the time period specified by the enabling act. However, the relatively long time period of one year specified for Covid-19 measures at the Federal level made this a relatively weak form of scrutiny.",No constraints on scrutiny through debates and committee proceedings. A good deal of scrutiny through the amendment of primary legislation. Weaker scrutiny of executive decrees in Congress,"Parliament has not played a significant oversight role (mainly due to the lengthy adjournments) but has mandated committees to provide ongoing oversight (e.g. Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic set up on 20/4/2020). Oversight of parliament limited by adjournments, unanimous consent procedure and limits placed on Covid-19 related questions and debate sessions",Very little direct involvement in the public health response by Congress. Much more involvement and oversight of the econmic and social responses. New legislation is required for spending by the executive. A number of committees established to scrutinise the government's response between May and October 2020. Minister of Health was impeached in September 2020,Weak or non-existent powers over oversight,"The Legislative Assembly can  exert political control through investigative commissions that can call attention to a specific governmental issue or action. To date, no such commission has been initiated. 

Legislative Assembly can harm or hinder the executive’s agenda through the temporary modification of procedural rules. During the pandemic, the procedure has been used to expedite the passage of bills to amend the national budget and to approve extraordinary budgetary measures to fund anti-Covid-19 programs",Formal powers to oversee the executive. But effectively a one-party state in terms of parliamentary representation which curtials scrutiny and oversight,"Parliament’s oversight takes two forms. First, exceptional powers are put to parliament in the shape of an Act after a state of emergency is called. Second, provisional exceptions to the basic rights that are made through Government decrees by virtue of Section 23 of the Constitution during a state of emergency are submitted to the Parliament. Both pass or fall on a simple majority of Parliament.","French Parliament generally does not scrutinise secondary legislation [para 32]. So no public health regulations were scrutinised by parliament. But health emergency was enacted and powers under that could only be extended beyond a month by means of primary statute, so giving Parliament a veto over powers enacted under the state of emergency [para 22]. Government was delegated further powers under two statutes which allowed the government to issue ordinances. Scrutiny over ordinances is weak and are very likely to become law [see main document for reference], but were subject to a 3 month sunset clause.","Powers given to the Ministry of Health under section 5 of the Infection Protection Act 2000 requires a declaration by the Bundestag. If the Bundestag repeals its declaration then all regulations cease with immediate effect (and there is a sunset clause dated 31/3/2021) [para 35]. But, it is a take it or leave it power as the Bundestag cannot amend or reject individual regulations. An amendment to section 5 in November 2020 to require oral reporting by the Federal Government sought to remedy the scrutiny deficit [para 36]","A weak legislature, but 18 Legislative Council panels are tasked with monitoring the performance of the government in relation to specific policy areas, including the Panel on Constitutional Affairs, the Panel on Health Services, and the Panel on Welfare Services.

Debates were held on Covid-19 measures and committees continued to sit.,"Committees were able to continue their oversight roles despite the caretaker government trying to circumvent at the beginning of the pandemic. Later, the new coalition weakened some of these mechanisms. Parliamntary questions were used extensively for oversight purposes.","Statutory decrees transposed to ordinary legislation after 60 days - this allows parliament to oversee the activity of the government. Parliament has been able to effectively scrutinise, amend and influence decree-making powers of the government.","Special Select Committee on Covid-19 was estbalished and met in a hybrid form. The Prime Minister has broken tradition by no allowing oversight committees to be chaired by members of the opposition.  In March 2020, an eight-member bipartisan Special Select Committee of the House of Representatives of Parliament was established to oversee the Government’s response to the pandemic, chaired by the Minister of Health and Wellness. Oversight has been weakened by failure of the governemnt to circulate information between members of parliament prior to sessions.","The Saeima carries out parliamentary scrutiny of the executive branch in numerous ways, including through the work of its committees. If Members of the Saeima are dissatisfied with the work of a particular sector, they may submit an inquiry to the government. If the Saeima supports the inquiry, it may decide, in the context of the inquiry, to hold a vote of confidence in the relevant minister or the entire Cabinet. Additionally, Members of the Saeima may submit questions to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Governor of the Bank of Latvia regarding matters within the scope of competence of these officials. Answers may be submitted in writing or provided in person at the relevant sitting of the Saeima.","Weak powers of scrutiny for Parliament versus the government. The legislature exercised a very limited degree of oversight over the normative acts of the executive, including those relating to quarantining entire areas, curfews and full closure of businesses and public places, unlike what would be expected in such circumstances.","Despite powers for Congress to oversee the response to the pandemic, the first hearing was only held on 30/9/2020. Congress had no say in the declaration of emergency",The packaging of emergency ordinances into the Covid-19 Justice and Security (Interim Measures) Act 2020 gave Parlaiement greater powers of scrutiny after intititally having very little power over emergency ordinances,"All secondary legislation reviewed by the Regulations Review Committee, and the Committee’s recommendations were reflected in later health orders [para 44]. Delegated legisaltion can be disallowed by parliament if referred by the Committee, but this did not occur during the pandemic.",Tthe regime under the Norwegian Corona Act 2020 provided for more extensive parliamentary scrutiny of regulations passed under the Act than for ordinary regulations. Normal ex post scrutiny mechanisms [para 30 & 32] strengthened to include the ability for parliament to veto a regulation (one-third of Storting members required to veto) to off-set the strong powers of the executive to amend or repeal existing statute (Henry VIII powers in the UK). Powers could only come into force one day after being introduced to parliament to allow time for a veto to be issued.,Executive dominance of the legisalture makes scrutiny difficult. Ordinances have been used that largely avoid or delayt scrutiny from the legislature. A Joint Parliamnetary Committee was established and chaired by the Speaker of the National Assembly. But the committee was eventually boycotted by opposition parties who accused the speaker of bias towards the ruling party.,Under the state of emergency scrutiny was limited by the reduction in parliamentary activity. Government acted unchecked between 2/5/2020 and 6/11/2020,State of emergency declared by President but must be approved within 5 days by the parliament and each subsequent 30 day extension had to be approved by parliament. Emergency decress had to be laid before parliament for ratification (ex post),Scrutiny was limited.

The DMA required the NDMC to submit reports to parliament for scrutiny.",Special Committee for the response to Covid-19 established.,"Regular scruitny has taken place throughout the pandemic. Extensions of states of alarm have been approved by Congress. Government measures have been scrutinised by way of interpollations and questions and by ministers appearing before Committees. A new committee - the Parliamentary Committee for the Social and Economic Reconstruction - was established on 7/5/2020. The final report of the committee, setting out strategic actions for the economic recovery from the pandemic, was approved by parliament on 29/7/2020","Central oversight role for Committee on the Constitution. 35.	The Committee decided on 24 March 2020 to postpone its usual spring control of the government until further notice on account of the Covid-19 outbreak.

These don't seem to have been used to strongly scrutinise the government's pandemic response,Weak oversight powers of parliament since the 2014 coup. No oversight role over exectuive decree or rule-making powers. The coalition government prematurely closed sessions to prevent debate on three emergency decrees on the Covid-19 budget,"There is no ongoing parliamentary oversight over ordinary presidential decrees, by-laws, and circulars, all of which are the main legal instruments in the Covid-19 response. Questions have been answered slowly, or sometimes not at all, byt the Government","Widespread exercise of delegated powers [permitted through primary legislation in the case of the Coronavirus Act 2020] means parliament has not had a chance to scutinise C-19 measures. As of 8/9/2020, 210 Covid-19 UK SIs had been made - 162 using negative resolution procedures meaning they are immediately effective unless explicitly voted down. Conventions were broken in regard to laying out SIs under negative procedure  21 days before coming into force for more than two-thirds of cases. Most of the public health emergency powers enacted under existing primary legislation requires subsequent ratification, which it received in parliament, although scrutiny was curtailed during this process. Commons scruitny also curtailed by inability to amend SIs [can only accept or reject]. Select Committees have played an important oversight role [but this is ex post oversight for the large part?]","Congress has not acted to limit the authority of the President during the pandemic.

Consensus notes,Notes on consensus over response,LAC19 country report,Opposition parties criticised the suspension in the first month of the pandemic and asked the Supreme Court to judge on the legal validity of virtual sessions [possibly more for clarity than in opposition to virtual proceeding]. Local level parliaments moved much faster towards hybrid proceedings. Some opposition legislators raised concerns about the appropriateness of continued executive rule-making when Congressional law-making was in full operation,Opposition parties strongly opposed a provision within the bill which would have given the Federal Minister of Finance the possibility for an overdraft of up to 28 billion Euros of the expenditures projected in the bill without giving any details on the purpose of this overdraft except “financial countering of the pandemic”. This was criticised as being incompatible with the constitutional requirement of a transparent (federal) budget.

Closed door negotiations for emergency lawmaking have been criticised. A lack of representation has been highlighted when Parliament passed Bill C-12, which was emergency legislation, on 13 March, when only “a small number of senior MPs” were present, a disproportionate number were from Ontario and Quebec. This is problematic as the views expressed during negotiations would not have represented the regional diversity across Canada.
